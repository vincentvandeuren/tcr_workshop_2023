ClusTCR uses a 2-step method, first dividing the data into supercluster, before clustering TCR sequences with high sequence similarity. Further information on ClusTCR and all of its possibilities can be found here: https://svalkiers.github.io/clusTCR/\n","\n","When you use this notebook in google colab, run the first few cells in this notebook to install conda and the ClusTCR package.\n","\n","If you want to use these notebooks on your local machine, just skip these first three cells and directly import pandas and the clustcr
